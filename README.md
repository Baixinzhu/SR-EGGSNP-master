This is our Pytorch implementation for our paper.

## Paper data and code

This is the code for the Paper: [Gated graph spiking neural P network for session-based recommendation]. We have implemented our methods in **Pytorch 1.10**.

Here are two datasets we used in our paper. After downloaded the datasets, you can put them in the folder `datasets/`:

- YOOCHOOSE: <http://2015.recsyschallenge.com/challenge.html> or <https://www.kaggle.com/chadgostopp/recsys-challenge-2015>

- DIGINETICA: <http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup> or <https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11161>

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyTorch 1.10.0
